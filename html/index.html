        <h2>Appalachian Region</h2>
        <p>Appalachia is a cultural region in the Eastern United States that stretches from the Southern Tier of New York to northern Alabama and Georgia.<br>
             While endowed with abundant natural resources, especially coal, Appalachia has long struggled and been associated with poverty. Native American <br>
             hunter-gatherers first arrived in what is now Appalachia over 16,000 years ago. Since then there has been many influences in the Appalachian culture, <br>
             influences such as Scottish, English, African American, German, and Irish. Each of these regions have made an influence in the music, traditions, and <br>
             styles of living in the Appalachian region.</p>

                        One of the most iconic symbols of Appalachian culture— the banjo— was brought to the region by African-American slaves in the 18th century. Black banjo players were performing in Appalachia as early as 1798, when their presence was documented in Knoxville, Tennessee.
